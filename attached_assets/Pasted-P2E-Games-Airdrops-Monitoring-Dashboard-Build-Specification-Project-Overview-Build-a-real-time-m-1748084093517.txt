P2E Games & Airdrops Monitoring Dashboard - Build Specification
Project Overview
Build a real-time monitoring dashboard that tracks Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, airdrops, and new cryptocurrency listings to identify the hottest opportunities as they become available.
Core Requirements
1. Web Scraping Engine

Multi-source scraper for the following websites:

https://airdropalert.com/blogs/list-of-p2e-airdrops/
https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-play-to-earn-games/
https://nftevening.com/best-play-to-earn-games/
https://playtoearn.com/blockchaingames/
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shitcoin/ (new listings monitoring)


Scraping frequency: Every 5-15 minutes for hot opportunities, hourly for general updates
Anti-detection measures: Rotating user agents, proxy support, request throttling
Error handling: Retry logic, fallback mechanisms, logging system

2. Data Processing & Intelligence

Content parsing to extract:

Game/project names and descriptions
Airdrop requirements and deadlines
Token launch dates and details
Social media metrics (followers, engagement)
Market cap and trading volume data
Website links and social handles


Hotness scoring algorithm based on:

Recency of announcement (newest = highest score)
Social media engagement rates
Trading volume and market activity
Community growth metrics
Airdrop value estimates



3. Real-time Dashboard Interface

Live feed section: Real-time updates of new opportunities
Hotness ranking: Top 20 hottest opportunities with scores
Category filters: P2E Games, Airdrops, New Listings, DeFi, NFTs
Time filters: Last hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, week
Search functionality: By project name, blockchain, category
Detailed cards showing:

Project thumbnail/logo
Key metrics and requirements
Time remaining for airdrops
Quick action buttons (visit site, join discord, follow Twitter)



4. Alert System

Push notifications for opportunities scoring above threshold
Email alerts with customizable frequency
Discord/Telegram bot integration for instant notifications
Custom alert rules: Based on keywords, market cap ranges, specific blockchains
FOMO indicators: Urgency badges for time-sensitive opportunities

5. Technical Architecture
Backend Stack

Language: Python with FastAPI or Node.js with Express
Web scraping: Scrapy/BeautifulSoup (Python) or Puppeteer/Playwright (Node.js)
Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching
Task queue: Celery (Python) or Bull (Node.js) for scheduled scraping
API: RESTful endpoints with real-time WebSocket connections

Frontend Stack

Framework: React with Next.js or Vue.js with Nuxt
Real-time updates: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
UI Components: Responsive design with dark mode support
Charts: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
State management: Redux/Zustand or Vuex/Pinia

Infrastructure

Deployment: Docker containers on AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean
Monitoring: Application performance monitoring and error tracking
Caching: Redis for frequently accessed data
Rate limiting: To prevent API abuse
Backup: Automated database backups

6. Key Features Implementation
Hot Opportunity Detection
pythondef calculate_hotness_score(opportunity):
    score = 0
    # Recency boost (newer = hotter)
    hours_old = (now - opportunity.created_at).hours
    score += max(100 - hours_old * 2, 0)
    
    # Social engagement
    score += min(opportunity.twitter_followers / 1000, 50)
    score += min(opportunity.discord_members / 500, 30)
    
    # Market activity
    if opportunity.trading_volume > 100000:
        score += 40
    
    # Airdrop value estimate
    if opportunity.estimated_value > 500:
        score += 30
    
    return min(score, 300)  # Cap at 300
Real-time Data Flow
